Write an rpn (reverse polish notation) calculator.
It receives its input from a file (command line or standard input).
Each line is either a number or an operator.
If it is a number it goes into a stack.
If its an operator it operates on the two topmost elements of the stack
and stores the result back onto the stack.

The program should support all 4 operators (+,-,/,*).

At the end the program prints the state of the stack.

Example input:
2
3
+

Example output:
5
